(For any advice, tutorial, help, whatever I am more than glad to listen and chat with whomever just contact me at discord: Jordan Connor#6458)


The idea of this mod was made basically by making it more bareble with Higher Difficulty mods such as Trials of Odin﻿ or Unidarkshin's Overhaul﻿.
As I stated before please be patient. This is my ever attempt to ever make a mod at all and even with the 0 knowledge I had with the language of C#.
This mod is made posible by the Skill Injector by Pipakin.﻿
Some ideas that I have I quickly gave up on due to the existence of beautifully made mods such as:


Gathering Skill by Pipakin
﻿﻿﻿﻿Fitness Skill by Pipakin
﻿Cartography by Advize
Cooking Skill by thegreyham


Mod not Compatible with:


- Valheim Plus
(WAS being looked at with them)﻿

- Skillful﻿﻿
(Added the crouch speed as "fix")﻿


﻿What this mod includes and what is yet to come:


(All of them mostly configurable and can be individually enabled or disabled)

Includes:


New Skills:

____________________________________________________________________________________


Strength: 

Increases Max Carry Weight
﻿﻿
﻿﻿You can increase this skill by making some exercise.

Spoiler:  Show

(BETA) Crafting 0.2 NEW!
﻿Decrese or Increase the cost of crafting.


You can choose the middle point, if wanted:
Now you say the amount to be multiplied at the begging and the amount to be divided at the end with a configurable middle point.
You can also select this middle point to be either 0 or 100 if you dont want multiplier or divider.

Multiplier: Makes the objects cost more at the begging (Level 0), if the Middle Level is 0 then it jumps it.

Divider: Makes the objects cost less at the end (Level 100), if the Middle Level is 100 then it jumps it.

All these number are Configurable.


Many bugs will show up for sure, even incompatibilities. I have tried with Epic Loots﻿ and Simple Recycling﻿ and both work wonderful.
(Bronze is not affected as it reads it twice and becomes an infinite number, no idea how to fix it, tried many things these 3 days tho... haha)
